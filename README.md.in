## Details

### Build arguments & environment variables

The container defines several build arguments which are copied to corresponding
environment variables within the running container. All the arguments/variables
have names starting with `PHP_` prefix. All the scripts respect these
variables, so the easiest way to adjust the container to your needs is to set
environment variables (`-e` flag to [docker](https://docker.com/)). There are
some exceptions currently -- `PHP_UID`, `PHP_GID` must be defined at build
time, so they may only be changed via docker's build arguments.

| Argument                    | Default Value        | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PHP\_UID                    | 1000                 | UID of the user running commands within the container (cli). |
| PHP\_GID                    | 1000                 | GID of the user running commands within the container (cli). |
